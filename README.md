# ASCII Render Engine

The program takes a different approach to rendering 3D objects from the conventional approach of using rays from the camera, or whatever the conventional approach is (I don't know). The way it works requires that every 3D object be described by a parametric surface equation. Refer to [Details](#details) for the juicy math. Refer to [Usage](#usage) to run the program or add in your own cool shapes.
